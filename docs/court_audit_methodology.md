# Court Audit Methodology: Lawful Public Records Process Review

## Overview

This document outlines a methodology for conducting a lawful audit of child welfare court records as part of prototype evaluation. The audit is designed as a **public records process review** with explicit exclusions, oversight, and ethical safeguards.

## Audit Scope

### Legal Framework
- Conducted under public records laws and court administrative procedures
- No access to confidential case information
- Process-level review only (patterns, workflows, timelines)
- Independent oversight required

### Exclusions (Mandatory)
- No individual case details or personally identifiable information
- No confidential court documents or sealed records
- No access to active case files or pending proceedings
- No contact with parties involved in cases

### Oversight Requirements
- Court administrator approval required
- Independent ethics reviewer participation
- Legal counsel consultation throughout
- Regular progress reporting to oversight committee

## Methodology Framework

### Phase 1: Process Mapping (Weeks 1-2)
- Document court intake and assignment procedures
- Map case progression timelines and decision points
- Identify workflow bottlenecks and resource allocation patterns
- Establish baseline process metrics

### Phase 2: Pattern Analysis (Weeks 3-6)
- Analyze aggregate case progression patterns
- Identify common decision pathways and outcomes
- Document process variations across case types
- Establish process efficiency benchmarks

### Phase 3: Comparative Review (Weeks 7-8)
- Compare court processes against child welfare standards
- Identify areas for process improvement
- Document best practices and successful patterns
- Develop recommendations for process optimization

## Metrics Templates

### Process Efficiency Metrics
- Average time from intake to initial hearing
- Case assignment distribution patterns
- Court calendar utilization rates
- Administrative processing timelines

### Quality Assurance Metrics
- Process compliance rates with court standards
- Documentation completeness patterns
- Decision consistency across similar cases
- Error identification and correction rates

### Resource Utilization Metrics
- Court staff workload distribution
- Facility and technology utilization
- External service coordination patterns
- Training and development needs identification

## Ethical and Safety Considerations

### Human Rights Protection
- No analysis of individual case outcomes or decisions
- Focus exclusively on process and administrative patterns
- All findings aggregated and anonymized
- No recommendations affecting individual cases

### Data Privacy

### Quality Control
- Peer review of analytical methods
- Validation of data collection procedures
- Cross-verification of findings
- Documentation of methodological decisions

### Transparency Requirements
- Public disclosure of audit methodology
- Stakeholder input opportunities
- Regular progress updates
- Final report publication with limitations clearly stated

## Implementation Plan

### Preparation Phase
- Secure court administrator approval
- Assemble independent oversight committee
- Develop detailed data collection protocols
- Train audit team on ethical procedures

### Execution Phase
- Conduct process mapping interviews
- Collect aggregate process data
- Perform pattern analysis
- Validate findings with oversight committee

### Reporting Phase
- Prepare aggregate findings report
- Present to court administration and stakeholders
- Publish methodology and limitations
- Archive audit materials securely

## Risk Mitigation

### Process Risks
- Clear scope boundaries prevent overreach
- Independent oversight prevents bias
- Ethical guidelines ensure appropriate conduct
- Legal consultation ensures compliance

### Operational Risks
- Pilot scope limits impact
- Human-in-the-loop review required
- No automated decisions or actions
- Full accountability maintained by operators

## Contact and Support
