## Subject: Prototype Decision-Support System for Child Welfare Intake Screening

Dear [Jefferson County CPS Director Name],

I am Zachary Hulse, a local engineer in Emory, Texas, working on a prototype decision-support system designed to help child welfare agencies surface early risk signals for human review.

The system is advisory-only, requires human-in-the-loop at all times, and is designed for prevention-oriented workflows. It has been developed with governance constraints to ensure safety and institutional compatibility.

We are seeking constrained pilot evaluation in counties that could benefit from additional support in intake screening. The pilot would be limited-scope, air-gapped, and focused on supporting human decision-making in intake processes. Any metrics or outcomes would be agreed upon jointly.

If your county is interested in learning more about this prototype, I would be happy to provide additional documentation and discuss how it might fit within your current processes.
