# County Selection for First Pilot

## Selection Criteria
- Population: 150k-400k
- Operationally stressed but not scandal-saturated
- Technically under-resourced
- Director with tenure, not ambition

## Candidate Counties

### Webb County (Laredo area, ~280k population)
- **Border-adjacent inland**: High operational stress from poverty and migration patterns
- **Technical under-resourcing**: Limited IT infrastructure in border region
- **Scandal risk**: Moderate due to federal border attention and immigration-related scrutiny
- **Director tenure**: Likely, but border politics may introduce ambition factors

### Jefferson County (Beaumont area, ~250k population)
- **Post-industrial**: High operational stress from economic decline and legacy industry challenges
- **Technical under-resourcing**: Aging systems from industrial era, vendor fatigue likely
- **Scandal risk**: Low, no recent high-profile investigations
- **Director tenure**: High probability - post-industrial counties often have stable leadership

### Hays County (San Marcos area, ~240k population)
- **Rural-urban hybrid**: Moderate operational stress with data blind spots
- **Technical resources**: Some access due to Austin proximity, but rural areas under-resourced
- **Scandal risk**: Low, growing but stable community
- **Director tenure**: Possible, but growth may introduce ambition

Jefferson County ranks highest for pilot survivability due to:
- Clear operational stress from post-industrial decline without scandal saturation

- Highest probability of director tenure in stable leadership environment
