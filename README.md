# Civic Shield Network (CSN) Pilot Package

## Welcome to CSN

The Civic Shield Network (CSN) is a **distributed, resilient framework** for protecting people and assets through autonomous-but-human-supervised detection, alerting, and response. This pilot package contains everything needed to deploy your first CSN node.

## What's Included

This package provides complete documentation for CSN pilot deployment:

- **[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)** - Security framework, threat model, and responsible disclosure
- **[GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md)** - Ethical guidelines, human oversight, and accountability
- **[DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md)** - Complete node setup and maintenance procedures
- **[METRICS.md](METRICS.md)** - Evaluation framework and success criteria
- **[CALL_SCRIPT.md](CALL_SCRIPT.md)** - Outreach templates for recruiting participants

## Quick Start

### For Organizations
1. **Review Documentation**: Start with SECURITY.md and GOVERNANCE.md
2. **Assess Fit**: Determine if CSN aligns with your protection needs
3. **Contact Us**: Reach out for deployment assistance
4. **Deploy Node**: Follow DEPLOYMENT.md for setup
5. **Join Network**: Connect with other pilot participants

### For Technical Teams
1. **Read DEPLOYMENT.md**: Understand hardware/software requirements
2. **Prepare Hardware**: Raspberry Pi 4B with 32GB storage minimum
